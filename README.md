## Final-Project-Machine-Learning
# All the work for the final project for Machine Learning on the United States Presidential Speeches data.

The United States Presidential Speeches dataset is a vast collection of presidential speeches throughout the history of the United States of America, starting from 04/30/1789 all the way until 09/25/2019. The dataset was created by Joseph Lilleberg via data from The Miller Center at the University of Virginia and is available on Kaggle. It displays the different political eras together with the different ideologies that helped shape and develop the USA into the country that it is today. 
The dataset is diverse and can be engaged for different types of research questions, ranging from the differences between time periods to the differences between individual presidents. The aim of this project however will be to provide an insight into the differences between the political affiliations of the Presidents, so which party they represent regardless of time period or which exact President made the speech. In respect to this query the "presidential_speeches.csv" will be used.  This and all other datasets are available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/littleotter/united-states-presidential-speeches?select=presidential_speeches.csv
